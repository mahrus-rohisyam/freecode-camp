      Habibie was a native of Parepare, in South Sulawesi. He was of ethnic Bugis-Gorontalese-Javanese descent from Kabila in Gorontalo and Yogyakarta. His parents, Alwi Abdul Jalil Habibie, an agriculturist of Bugis-Gorontalese descent, and R. A. Tuti Marini Puspowardojo, a Javanese noblewoman from Yogyakarta, met while studying in Bogor. Habibie's paternal family comes from Kabila, just to the east of the town of Gorontalo in northern Sulawesi. He was the fourth of eight children. 
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
      Habibie's father died when he was 14 years old. In 2018, the Gorontalo provincial government agreed to support the construction of the B.J. Habibie's Monument in front of the main gate of Djalaluddin Airport in Gorontalo Regency. In addition, it was proposed that State University of Gorontalo be renamed in honour of Habibie although, in the end, the suggestion was not adopted.
